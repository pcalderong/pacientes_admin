# Pacientes Admin - Proyect

This app is intended to be for Proyecto Daniel. 

Proyecto Daniel is an organization dedicated to help young people with cancer, giving them support inside/outside the hospitals with the main intention of help them on on the process, as well as the families.
The app under construction consists on an Admin Tool to manage some important information about the young people in the organization, so we can have reports, and data analysis.

It's expected to finish this application by the end of January, 2016.
